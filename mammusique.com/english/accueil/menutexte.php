  them worked out an original musical project for accordion, violin, viola 
  and vocals by altering the usual role of each musical instrument.<br>
  <br>
  A new jazz form was born that transmuted folklore and ethnic world music into 
  original compositions, arrangements and improvisations. Stimulating and natural, 
  this provocative fiesta of rhythms and melodies feeds on acoustic explorations 
  and the urge to sing and bring together new sounds. Musicians are </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><font size="2">welcome 
  </font></font><font size="2">to join as guests while listeners are </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><font size="2">invited</font></font><font size="2"> 
  to the feast.<br>

  These two restless musicians, the founders of MAM, often play in duos; yet, 
  always anxious to make novel musical encounters they delight in performing with 
  fellow musicians of different backgrounds. They recorded 8 CD&#8217;s with Buda 
  Musique (the second to last, &quot;Paris Village&quot; was an order from the publisher 
  Kosinus) in various formations from duet to quintet (guest cello, percussion 
  and drums). Their version of &#8220;Mission Impossible&#8221; (Lalo Schiffrin) 
  was twice compiled and played on tv (France 2). They recorded 3 CD&#8217;s with 
  Japanese singers, participated in those by Mama Kaya (2), Thomas Pitiot (2), 
  G&eacute;rard Pitiot (3), Jean Piero, Alifair, Gilliane Kim, Thomasi (2). </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><font size="2">They

  put on a Brassens performance minus guitar and moustache but with the female

Travelling is for them an &#8220;art de vivre&#8221;, no wonder they have often 
  performed abroad: Montreal, Vancouver, Halifax, Ouagadougou, Tripoli, St Louis
