                    We feel a commitment to play in kindergartens, primary and secondary schools
                    as well as holiday centers&#8230;<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8230; Indeed Mam&#8217;s music serves the purpose very well with its
                    fresh experimental eclectism.<br>
                    <br>
                    Its rhythmic interactions, sung or improvised, its imaginative versions
                    of the most recent pieces present youth listeners with new approaches
                    concerning rhythm, instruments and sound.<br>
                    <br>
                    This is probably the reason why Mam&#8217;s youth concerts have met with
                    such success recently : regional tours in the &#8220;Grenoble Jazz Festival&#8221;
                    and &#8220;Jazz en Auvergne&#8221; (with workshops and masterclasses in
                    addition to concerts), tours for &quot;Les Jeunesses Musicales de France&quot; and the holiday centers of &#8220;Caisse
                    Centrale d&#8217;Action Sociale&#8221;.<br>
