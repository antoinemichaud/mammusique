            Michaud</a> have been playing happily together since 1992. The two of
        them worked out an original musical project for accordion, violin, viola
        and vocals by altering the usual role of each musical instrument.<br>
        <br>
        A new jazz form was born that transmuted folklore and ethnic world music into
        original compositions, arrangements and improvisations. Stimulating and natural,
        this provocative fiesta of rhythms and melodies feeds on acoustic explorations
        and the urge to sing and bring together new sounds. Musicians are welcome
        to join as guests while listeners are invited
        to the feast.<br>

        These two restless musicians, the founders of MAM, often play in duos; yet,
        always anxious to make novel musical encounters they delight in performing with
        fellow musicians of different backgrounds. They recorded 8 CD&#8217;s with Buda
        Musique (the second to last, &quot;Paris Village&quot; was an order from the publisher
        Kosinus) in various formations from duet to quintet (guest cello, percussion
        and drums). Their version of &#8220;Mission Impossible&#8221; (Lalo Schiffrin)
        was twice compiled and played on tv (France 2). They recorded 3 CD&#8217;s with
        Japanese singers, participated in those by Mama Kaya (2), Thomas Pitiot (2),
        G&eacute;rard Pitiot (3), Jean Piero, Alifair, Gilliane Kim, Thomasi (2). They
        &#8220;made a pass&#8221; at the racy swing musette of accordionist virtuoso
        Fran&ccedil;ois Parisi (&quot;Jazz in my Musette&quot;). They
        put on a Brassens performance minus guitar and moustache but with the female
        singer Gu&eacute;na&euml;lle and are currently working on 4 ambitious multifaced
        projects: &quot;Meddled Times&quot; with Fab, a famous French-Newyorker musician and
        sound engineer, &quot;New Time&quot; with the fantastic showman Norbert &quot;Touski&quot; Lucarain, playing human beatbox
        and keyboards together!
        (these 2 shows featuring VJing and machines) then, &quot;M&eacute;lodies Extras
        Ordinaires&quot; (featuring
        the actress C&eacute;line Caussimon), and &quot;La M&eacute;lodie des Choses&quot; (featuring Pauline Borras, de La Compagnie Pr&eacute;fabriqu&eacute;e), two musical tales with theater, dance, video and chineese shadows. In 2015, they created &quot;Human Swing Box&quot; and recorded the album, still playing with Touski.<br>
        <br>
        Travelling is for them an &#8220;art de vivre&#8221;, no wonder they have often
        performed abroad: Montreal, Vancouver, Halifax, Ouagadougou, Tripoli, St Louis
        in Senegal, Tlemcen, Skopje, Ljubjana, Innsbruck, Dresden, Bruges, Freiburg
        (CH), Halmstad,  Santo-Domingo, Cap-Haitien, Caracas, Iquitos, Dubai&#8230; in addition to crisscrossing hexagonal France. This season&#8217;s
        menu : a DVD for &quot;Jazz in my Musette&quot;, a &quot;25 Years&quot; compilation album, and so, celebration concerts next fall.
